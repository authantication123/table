        <p>Full disclosure: We've totally gushed over Microsoft's microsites before. We can't help it <br> — what better way to revitalize an old-school brand than with a blog that boasts beautiful, interactive, and inspiring branded content? Plus, the square images in the layout of these stories are reminiscent of the <br> Microsoft logo. This helps it achieve valuable brand consistency.

            Microsoft Work & Life is also a prime example of how a business blog can be a major asset for an overall rebrand. In recent years, <br> Microsoft has worked to humanize its brand, largely in response to a rivalry with Apple.
            
            The "Work & Life" microsite has a simple tagline — "Learn how we're helping people stay connected, <br> engaged and productive — at work, at school, at home and at play." It's the softer side of Microsoft, so to speak.
            
            When you're trying to convey a certain brand message, you can use your blog <br> to communicate it — both aesthetically and content-wise</p>
